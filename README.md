# JDBC-CRUD-APP
This is a console-based application developed using core Java, JDBC, Connection Pooling (HikariCP), Factory Design Pattern, and Singleton Classes. It provides functionality to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database.

## Features

- **Create**: Insert new records into the database.
- **Read**: Retrieve and display existing records from the database.
- **Update**: Modify existing records in the database.
- **Delete**: Remove records from the database.

## Technologies Used

- Java: The application is built using core Java.
- JDBC: Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is used to interact with the database.
- HikariCP: A high-performance, lightweight connection pooling library for efficient database connection management.
- Factory Design Pattern: Implemented to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client code.
- Singleton Classes: Ensures a single instance of certain classes throughout the application.
